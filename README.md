# Custom Chatbot Exploration Project

## Introduction

This project is an exploration into the possibilities of creating a custom chatbot using OpenAI models and the LangChain JavaScript library. The primary objective is to investigate, test, and evaluate different tools and techniques that are useful in building efficient and effective chatbot systems. 

We are continuously exploring new technologies and libraries, and it's likely that we will be experimenting with other models and libraries in the future. 

Please note that this project is not intended to be a production-ready application. Instead, it is a learning and discovery platform to discover how to interact with various AI models and tooling.

## Features

This project aims to develop:

1. A custom chatbot using the LangChain library.
2. A memory system for the chatbot to remember the context of conversations.
3. An integration mechanism to facilitate interaction with a knowledge base and communication  platforms such as Slack.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

1. LangChain JS library: For interaction with OpenAI's language models.
2. OpenAI's language models: For generating natural language responses.
3. React: For building the user interface for the web version of the chatbot.
4. Yarn and Yarn Workspaces: For managing dependencies and monorepo structure.
5. TypeScript: As the main programming language.

## Development

This project is still in the early stages of development. We are actively exploring the capabilities of the LangChain JS library and OpenAI's language models, as well as considering other models and libraries, to continuously improve and expand the functionality of the chatbot.
